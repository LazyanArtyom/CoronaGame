# Abstract

It is planned to develop a software toolkt, the purpose of which is to describe the epidemic phenomena, also to introduce possible solutions to prevent the spread of diseases and viruses, thereby promoting newer methods for modeling the epidemic dynamics in cellular automata based self-organizing systems. Within this context, a multi-user software platform designed for conducting collective research and administration of dynamic processes will greatly contribute to the comprehensive analysis of epidemiological procedures and to dynamical prediction of target parameters, which in turn will make the behavior of the model under investigation at least partially controllable.
